THe do-what-it-says function is a function specific to text files within the folder of liri. This function defaults to the file random.txt but also accepts the file log.txt. the format in random.txt and log.txt MUST remain consistent or the code will break if given these commands. The files must contain the following format...

LIRI-COMMAND,PARAMETER,LIRI-COMMAND,PARAMETER (** NOTE: the first command does not start with a comma but every following command does **)

The random.txt is not updated within the program only the file log.txt is updated. Every time a command is run the program will add the command and argument to the log. If the log is empty the program will be sure to not append a comma in the beginning(which indicates an empty array index and breaks the code) if commands are already populating the file then the program will add the commas for formatting. random.txt does not change that file must be manually written(for testing purposes). Also not that each new command drops to a new line within the log.txt to appease the eye better. Before the log was running one continuous line out and it was very messy.

Sample log.txt: 
_____________________________________

spotify-this-song,blister in the sun
,movie-this,harry+potter
,my-tweets,jakegreer93
_____________________________________


random.txt:
_____________________________________

spotify-this-song,"I Want it That Way"
_____________________________________


The clear-log command does exactly what it says..It clears any commands appended to the log.txt file. This function works by first using npm inquirer to confirm with the user that they want to clear the log. Then the function grabs the log.txt file and rewrites a blank string to the file. The file will be completely empty and ready for more commands.
